William, 

About your programs...

Functionality

- Could not test functionality because programs cannot be compiled. Root cause
  seems to be the fact that the name of the file does not match the name of
  your class.  -1pt

Please make sure you read the problems well; follow instructions.


Style Check

- There is incorrect indentation. -1pt

Please make sure you follow the style guidelines. Penalties will be higher as
the semester moves forward.


Peace,
