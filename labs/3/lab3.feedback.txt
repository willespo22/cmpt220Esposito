William,

About your programs...

Functionality

- Could not test functionality because programs cannot be compiled. Root cause
  seems to be the fact that the name of the file does not match the name of
  your class.  -1pt

Please make sure you read the problems well; follow instructions.


Style Check

- Information in the header is incorrect.

Please make sure you follow the style guidelines and that your programs can be
compiled using javac. Penalties will be higher as the semester moves forward.

Peace,

- Dr. Rivas
