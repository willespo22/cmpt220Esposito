Will,

- Congratulations on coding one-dimensional convolution!

However, 

- The file you submitted does not correspond to the
  assignment given. 

- The program's file name does not coincide with the name of the class, thus,
  the program will not compile.

- Please read the style guidelines to make sure you understand them. Do not
  hesitate to ask any questions.

- Please read the assignment instructions carefully.


Peace,

- Dr. Rivas
