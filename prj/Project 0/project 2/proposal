Software Development I Project Proposal

	The New York Football Giants in the 2016 NFL season boasted an 11-5 record, and made the playoffs after a drought that went back to their super bowl victory in 2011. For my project, I propose a program that will be able to give the user a short synopsis of the starter of every position, the year they had, their statistics, and then provide picture(s) or perhaps even a short video highlight. The program will not just ask the user to enter a name as that would be assuming that they know the full names of all the starters, it will instead, ask the user to answer a series of questions that will then lead them to a person’s profile. For example, the first question will ask if they are looking for someone on OFFENSE, DEFENSE, or SPECIAL TEAMS.. Let’s assume they pick offense, after that, the program can ask if they are looking for a LINEMAN, or SKILLED POSITION player. Let’s assume they choose SKILLED POSITION player, it will then ask them to select QB, WR 1, WR 2, WR 3, TE, or RB. Let’s assume the user enters WR 1, it will then display a picture of Odell Beckham Jr., his statistics of the past season, a picture of him, a small writing about the season he had, and perhaps even a video of one of his many great plays. If the user entered QB, it would display Eli Manning, his statistics, a picture of him, a small writing about the season he had, and perhaps even a video of one of his plays that I felt was particularly compelling. The idea here is that the user will have a total of 28 different profiles to view, as there are 11 starters on offense, and 11 of defense, and 5 special teams/ This could be a database project, and it may become one, however, I will first attempt to accomplish it as an application project.
